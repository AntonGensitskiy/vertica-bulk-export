Plugin Configuration
---------------------

| Configuration | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :----- | :---------- |
| **Path** | **Y** | N/A | HDFS File path where exported data will be written. |
| **Delimiter** | **Y** | , | Delimiter in the output file. Values in each column is separated by this delimiter while writing to output file. |
| **Username** | **N** | N/A | User identity for connecting to the specified database. Required for databases that need authentication. Optional for databases that do not require authentication. |
| **Password** | **N** | N/A | Password to use to connect to the specified database. Required for databases that need authentication. Optional for databases that do not require authentication. |
| **Connection String** | **Y** | N/A | JDBC connection string including database name. |
| **selectStatement** | **Y** | N/A | Select command to select values from a vertica table |

Usage Notes
-----------

The plugin can be configured to connect to vertica table using jdbc, execute provided select query and write exported data to provided HDFS File. The parent directories for HDFS file does not need to be present, the plugin will create them if they do not exist. Plugin also has an option to choose column delimiter which defaults to comma. 
 
For running the vertica `select` query which can be found [here](https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/ConnectingToHPVertica/ClientJDBC/ExecutingQueriesThroughJDBC.htm.), the plugin uses vertica jdbc driver class and executes `select` query using that jdbc driver. The exported file will have all the column names as first row and remaining rows will be data. All the columns will be read as `String` and if there are `NULL` values in columns, plugin emits them as `null` string value.
